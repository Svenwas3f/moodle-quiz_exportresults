# Exportresults - Moodle Quiz PlugIn
The Moodle quiz activity gives unlimited access to online testing. A lot of question types provide an included check but some question types (e.g., Essay) are not designed for an auto check. Correcting those question types online in Moodle is unwieldy. With this plugin the teacher can export students answer as an ODT file. The ODT filetype was chosen because it is open source and the filetypes simplicity and the wide range of possibilities. With the ODT filetype it is possible to modify some layout options during the export process. At the same place, the teacher is able to select what group(s) he wants to export. The export has a meaningful folder structure that makes it easier to find someoneâ€™s answer.
